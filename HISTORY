=== 2.0.0 / 2009-11-11

* Rewritten from first principles! Faster, smarter, leaner and with more

=== 1.0.1 / 2009-04-23

* Now sort of framework-agnostic. I say "sort of", because what I've actually
  done is just copy and paste the chunks I needed out of ActiveSupport. I guess
  the goal would be to rewrite around these, but since I basically never need
  this for anything except Rails, it seems like overkill.

=== 1.0.0 / 2009-04-23

* Gemification and README
